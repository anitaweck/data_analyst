Part: Data Wrangling Project 3 - OpenStreetMap data 'Meddersheim and surroundings'

1. A pdf document containing your answers to the rubric questions. This file should document your data wrangling process.

The rubric questions are answered in in the uploaded iPhyton Notebook. This is the link: https://github.com/anitaweck/data_analyst/blob/master/DW_P3_OSM.ipynb

2. Your Python code for Lesson 6 quizzes, as well as any additional code you used in auditing and cleaning your dataset for the final project.

The complete code is available here: https://github.com/anitaweck/data_analyst/blob/master/DW_P3_OSM_Meddersheim.py.
The code for lesson 6 quizzes is within the udacity-platform stored: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud032-nd/l-768058569/e-842628572/m-849638576.

3. A text file containing a link to the map position you wrangled in your project, a short description of the area and a reason for your choice.

The map position who was wrangled is within the bounds-tag stored:
&lt;bounds minlat="49.7586" minlon="7.584" maxlat="49.8895" maxlon="7.9033"&gt;
It is also exported to the json-file 'P3_Meddersheim_Germany' (available as zip): https://github.com/anitaweck/data_analyst/blob/master/P3_Meddersheim_Germany.zip).

The area was chosen because it is my home region and I wanted to know how it is described in OSM. Also to see what kind of information might be missing.

4. An .osm file containing a sample part of the map region you used (around 1 - 10 MB in size). See instructor notes.

The original file is available in this zip-file: https://github.com/anitaweck/data_analyst/blob/master/Meddersheim_Bad-Muenster_Bad-Kreuznach_original.zip

5. A text file containing a list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).
